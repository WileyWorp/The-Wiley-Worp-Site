            <h2>It's Mother's Day</h2>

            <p>Happy Mother's Day, everyone! As I write this, I can't help but get reminded of these last couple weeks.
                Life has thrown some curveballs at me, though thankfully, none of them included hitting one into my eye
                this time! From almost facing a tornado at school to dealing with a flooded basement and a house fire,
                it's been a long couple weeks.
                <br> <br>
                About a month ago I was feeling unmotivated and inexplicably sad. And just when I got over that, those
                emotions resurfaced. Some people believe that bad things come in threes, and boy, did that hold true.
                First, a secure perimeter lockdown at school, then a tornado warning that caused me to stay at school
                for an extra hour after hours with teenage gossip surrounding me, and finally, the basement flood and
                house fire on the side of our house. But don't worry, we're mostly fine. Thankfully, we have homeowners
                insurance.
                <br> <br>
                Not long ago, I had this big realization; nothing stays bad forever. It might sound confusing, but hear
                me out. Life can be tough sometimes, and everything feels like it's going downhill. But guess what? It
                doesn't stay that way forever. There are always ups after the downs. It's like when you're stuck in the
                dark, but eventually, a bright light shines through. So, no matter what happens, remember that better
                days are on their way. Keep your chin up, and know that things will get better.
                <br> <br>
                Throughout the chaos, I want to mention the incredible strength and resilience of mothers. On this
                Mother's Day, their love and support shine bright, no matter the situation.
                <br> <br>
                So, to all the amazing mothers out there, thank you for being here. Happy Mother's Day!
