            <h2>Having an Older Sibling is Weird</h2>
            <p>Published on <time datetime="2023-05-22">May 22, 2023</time></p>
            <p>Hey, so I have this older brother. He’s great. He's a good student, an amazing sibling, and a great
                athlete. He's basically everything you can ask for. But here's the thing: I've always tried to be better
                than him. Having an older sibling is cool, but it's also kind of tough. We're almost from different
                generations. Sure we have some similar interests, but they’re also
                <br> <br>
                Ever since I was little, I've been competing with my brother. I couldn't be stopped. And you know what?
                It actually made me nearly as smart as him. But now, he's about to graduate high school. Like, today, as
                of writing this! After that, he's off to the military, and I won't have him to compete with anymore. It
                hit me recently that my whole life has been about trying to outdo my brother. And soon, he'll be gone.
                <br> <br>
                Honestly, I'm pretty scared about next school year. Most of my friends are leaving throughout the year,
                and I'll only have two left. But even one of those guys seems to be going in a different direction than
                me. I don't even want to get into the other dude. On the bright side, I'm a percussionist, so I'll have
                a class with other people like me. Maybe I can make some new friends there. The thing is, the three
                other percussionists in my class are already great friends, and they're pretty different people from me.
                Plus, the rest of the class will be sitting far away from the drum section which is in the back.
                <br> <br>
                Anyway, I'm just scared about the future. But hey, it can't be all bad, right? After all, nothing can
                be bad forever. Life's like a stock chart, going up and down, down and up, etc. Then it keeps going
                until it crashes and your time's up. Thanks for reading this. I appreciate you all. Have a fantastic
                day!

            <h2>It's Mother's Day</h2>
            <p>Published on <time datetime="2023-05-14">May 14, 2023</time></p>
            <p>Happy Mother's Day, everyone! As I write this, I can't help but get reminded of these last couple weeks.
                Life has thrown some curveballs at me, though thankfully, none of them included hitting one into my eye
                this time! From almost facing a tornado at school to dealing with a flooded basement and a house fire,
                it's been a long couple weeks.
                <br> <br>
                About a month ago I was feeling unmotivated and inexplicably sad. And just when I got over that, those
                emotions resurfaced. Some people believe that bad things come in threes, and boy, did that hold true.
                First, a secure perimeter lockdown at school, then a tornado warning that caused me to stay at school
                for an extra hour after hours with teenage gossip surrounding me, and finally, the basement flood and
                house fire on the side of our house. But don't worry, we're mostly fine. Thankfully, we have homeowners
                insurance.
                <br> <br>
                Not long ago, I had this big realization; nothing stays bad forever. It might sound confusing, but hear
                me out. Life can be tough sometimes, and everything feels like it's going downhill. But guess what? It
                doesn't stay that way forever. There are always ups after the downs. It's like when you're stuck in the
                dark, but eventually, a bright light shines through. So, no matter what happens, remember that better
                days are on their way. Keep your chin up, and know that things will get better.
                <br> <br>
                Throughout the chaos, I want to mention the incredible strength and resilience of mothers. On this
                Mother's Day, their love and support shine bright, no matter the situation.
                <br> <br>
                So, to all the amazing mothers out there, thank you for being here. Happy Mother's Day!
