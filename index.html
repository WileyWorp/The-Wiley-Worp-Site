            <p class="homeParagraph" style="font-size: .5cm;">Wiley Worp is a self proclaimed content creator that makes
                youtube videos and
                programs websites. Wiley's specific age, grade, relationships, etc is not public information but there
                are things about those that if you ask him, he might answer. Things like whether or not he's in school,
                and other things that aren't personal and that probably won't dox him.
                <br> <br>
                Wiley does not currently have a job but plans on it in the near future. He does freelance editing every
                once in a while and is hoping to do the same thing with programming websites soon. Right now he is
                working on this website, the one you're on right now, and a company named Worp Games, that has it's own
                "in-progress" website.
                <br> <br>
                Wiley has one main philosophy, "Nothing will be bad forever." This refers to the fact that you will have
                times where you <i>will</i> feel hopeless. Think of that situation like a hill range. You feel like you
                are going up an endless hill, you think that there is nothing you can do to feel good. But then,
                something comes up, a beacon of hope. You start running down the hill, feeling better than ever. This
                shows one thing. Even if you feel like from now on your life will be terrible forever, you're just going
                up that hill again, and no matter what, you'll get to the top, and you'll go down, feeling as good as
                someone can feel.
                <br> <br>
                Thank you for reading this, and have fun checking out this website.
